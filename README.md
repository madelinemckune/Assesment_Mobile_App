# Mobile App Development Intern Asessment

## Before You Get Started

To run an emulator on your computer, you will need either [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) which is available on Mac and Windows or [Xcode](downloaded from the Apple App Store).

## Your Task

The goal of this asessment is for you to clone a repo, create a single screen React Native app, and add an interesting feature to it.

1. Clone this repo and copy the contents into your own repo. Please name your repo [FIRST NAME]-[LAST NAME]-mobile-app
2. Inside this repo, create a [Expo React Native app](https://expo.io/learn)
3. Run `expo start`and select an emulator from the web interface to run (this will be dependent on whether you have Android Studio or Xcode)
4. Using Pure React Native Components(https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/components-and-apis.html) create a simple **About You** app. Your app should include:
   - A picture of yourself
   - A short bio (3-5 sentences)
   - An alert that says "Welcome to Pigpocket App!"
   - Some other interesting component
5. Either share access to your repo with @madelinemckune or zip up your project and email it to pigpocketrecruiting@gmail.com

## Please Note

Your app will be compared to other applicants. You have 48 hours to complete the asessment. Please do not spend more than 3 hours on your submission.
