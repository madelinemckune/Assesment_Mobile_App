# Mobile App Development Intern Asessment

## Before You Get Started

To run an emulator on your computer, you will need either [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) which is available on Mac and Windows or [Xcode](downloaded from the Apple App Store). If you would prefer, there is also an option to avoid installing Xcode or Android Studio, and testing the app from your [own mobile device](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/guides/testing-on-devices/). For more information on Expo, please refer to the [getting started documentation](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v36.0.0/get-started/create-a-new-app/). There are plenty of resources and tutorials online on how to create your first expo app if you are stuck.

## Your Task

The goal of this asessment is for you to clone a repo, create a single screen React Native app using Expo, and add an interesting feature to it.

1. Clone this repo and copy the contents into your own repo. Please name your repo [FIRST NAME]-[LAST NAME]-mobile-app
2. Inside this repo, there is a created [Expo React Native app](https://expo.io/learn)
3. Run `expo start` inside of the AboutMe project and select an emulator from the web interface to run (this will be dependent on whether you have Android Studio or Xcode). If you do not have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/get-started/installation/) installed on your computer, you will need to before you can continue.
4. Using pure React Native components(https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/components-and-apis.html) create a simple **About You** app. Your app should include:
   - A picture of yourself
   - A short bio (3-5 sentences)
   - An alert that says "Welcome to Pigpocket App!"
   - Some other interesting component
5. Either share access to your repo with @madelinemckune or zip up your project and email it to pigpocketrecruiting@gmail.com

## Please Note

Your app will be compared to other applicants. You have 48 hours to complete the asessment, but we do not expect you to spend more than 3 hours on it. You are allowed to use any and all resources available to you.
